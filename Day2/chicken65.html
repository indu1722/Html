<p><h3>There are several theories about the origins of the name “chicken 65,” let’s try to uncover the truth!
Chicken 65 is typically served as an appetizer or snack, and it is often accompanied by lemon wedges and a side of onion slices. It is known for its spicy, flavourful taste, and it is often made with a mixture of spices including ginger, garlic, cumin, turmeric, and chilli powder.

One theory is that the dish was created in 1965 by a chef at the Buhari restaurant in Chennai, India, and was named after the year in which it was created.
Another theory is that the dish was named after the number of chillies that were used in the original recipe. Yet another theory is that the name comes from the fact that the chicken is cut into 65 small pieces before it is cooked.</h3></p>
